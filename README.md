Mock up? I want to demonstrate the use of custom elements to encapsulate the drag and drop functionality. Again, this is more of a show off to my friends than anything ðŸ˜‚. Vanilla JS is the way!

## My Process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Continued Delevelopment

For now, the content is not dynamic, maybe later, I would add forms to let users add their own items to the "lanes", infact it would be better if I let users add their own lanes as well. But for now, it's simply to demostrate the drag and drop implementation using custom elements.
